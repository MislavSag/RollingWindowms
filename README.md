# RollingWindow

## Intro

The main purpose of this package is to calculate rolling window statistics **fast**. It is aimed at any users who need to calculate rolling statistics
on large data sets, and should be particularly useful for the types of
analysis done in the field of quantitative finance, even though the functions implemented are very general.

## Installing in [R]

```R
# install.packages("devtools") # if not installed

library(devtools)
install_github("andrewuhl/RollingWindow")
```

## Rolling Window Statistics

This package implements functions which efficiently calculate rolling window statistics in linear time using **single-pass** algorithms. Statistics implemented include:

* beta
* compounding
* covariance
* correlation
* kurtosis
* mean
* mean absolute error
* mean of squares
* mean squared error
* median
* min
* max
* product
* root mean squared error
* skewness
* standard deviation
* sum
* sum product
* sum of squares
* sum of squared errors
* variance
* z score.

_Note_: median is an exception as it is not calculated as a single pass algorithm, although it is still calculated quickly in O(n log window) using efficient algorithms.

Calling functions on rolling windows calculated within loops in [R] can be quite slow, even when proper attempts are made to vectorize operations within the loop. Due to performance issues, several other [R] packages implement commonly used
rolling window functions -- e.g. rolling mean or rolling standard deviation -- using the languages C, Fortran or C++. Both in pure [R] and in compiled language [R] packages, the implementation is usually the naive algorithm; each time a moving window moves forward by one increment, the function is recalulated over all values in the current window.

In this package, rolling window calculations are performed in a single pass, rather than using the naive algorithm. As a rolling window is moved forward, only the oldest value has to be eliminated from the window to calculate the new rolling window statistic. Various known single pass algorithms are used, including a version of Welford's algorithm for
calculating the variance. For minimum and maximum, a double-ended queue (dequeue)-based algorithm is employed. For median, for the rolling window case a circular (ring) buffer data structure is used in its algorithm which achieves O(n log window); for the expanding window case, two balanced priority queues are utilized.

This package's underlying functions are written in C++ and are built on top of the [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) package. In a simple set of
benchmarks comparing the performance of this package's rolling functions vs. a similar package (also using Rcpp) that
implements a subset of the same functions using the naive algorithm, this package's functions typically complete significantly faster, depending on the window size and function called. For large vector and/or window sizes, it is common to see a 100X+ performance improvement.

Further improvement in performance can be gained by parallelizing the rolling functions, and is left for future work.

## Usage

```R
# General form for single input (vector, matrix, list, etc.)
# result <- RollingFunction(x, window = 10)

# window size
w <- 10

# input vector
x <- rnorm(50)

# only input vector and window size required
avg <- RollingMean(x, window = w)

# std. deviation for population (n)
stddev_sample <- RollingStd(x, window = w, pop = FALSE)

# std. deviation for sample (n - 1)
stddev_pop <- RollingStd(x, window = w, pop = TRUE)

#-------------------------------------------------------------

# General form for functions with two input vectors
# result <- RollingFunction(x, y, window, ...)

# window size
w <- 10

# input vectors
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- rnorm(length(x))

corr    <- RollingCorr(x, y, window = w)
covar   <- RollingCov(x, y, window = w)
beta    <- RollingBeta(x, y, window = w)
sumprod <- RollingSumprod(x, y, window = w)

```

## Benchmarks - Setup

To get a sense of the performance improvement by calculating rolling window
statistics in a single pass, we can run the following in [R].

```R

library(RollingWindow)
library(RcppRoll)
library(microbenchmark)
library(rbenchmark)

# setup
set.seed(10)
n    <- 10000
x    <- rnorm(n); y = rnorm(n)
win  <- 1000
reps <- 10

# relative performance
cols <- c("test", "replications", "elapsed", "relative", "user.self")

```

### Benchmarks - Relative Performance vs. other C++ Implementation
For the first benchmark, let's compare the relative performance of this package's rolling window functions (written in C++) vs. another package's non-single pass implementation (also written in C++).

```R
benchmark(RollingMax(x, win),    roll_max(x, win), replications = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingMean(x, win),   roll_mean(x, win), replications = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingMedian(x, win), roll_median(x, win), replications = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingMin(x, win),    roll_min(x, win), replications = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingProd(x, win),   roll_prod(x, win), replications = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingVar(x, win),    roll_var(x, win), replications  = reps, columns = cols)

benchmark(RollingStd(x, win),    roll_sd(x, win), replications    = reps, columns = cols)

```

In the following table, the "relative" column shows relative performance.
The row with **1.0** is the faster of the two functions. For example, in the
standard deviation benchmark, RollingWindow's RollingStd() function
runs 121X faster than RcppRoll's roll_sd() function.

### Max

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingMax | 10 | 0.005 | **1.0** | 0.005 |
| roll_max | 10 | 0.546 | 109.2 | 0.547 |

### Mean

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingMean | 10 | 0.003 | **1.0** | 0.004 |
| roll_mean | 10 | 0.102 | 34 | 0.101 |

### Median

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingMedian | 10 | 0.018 | **1.0** | 0.019 |
| roll_median | 10 | 6.362 | 353.4 | 6.363 |

### Minimum

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingMin | 10 | 0.005 | **1.0** | 0.005 |
| roll_min | 10 | 0.688 | 137.6 | 0.686 |

### Product

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingProd | 10 | 0.004 | **1.0** | 0.003 |
| roll_prod | 10 | 0.170 | 42.5 | 0.165 |

### Standard Deviation

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingStd | 10 | 0.005 | **1.0** | 0.005 |
| roll_sd | 10 | 0.606 | 121.2 | 0.605 |

### Variance

| test | replications | elapsed | relative | user.self |
| ---- | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| RollingVar | 10 | 0.004 | **1.0** | 0.004 |
| roll_var | 10 | 0.535 | 133.8 | 0.534 |

In all cases, RollingWindow's functions are much faster, between 34X and 353X.

```
Note that the time unit of the result is _microseconds_. If we look at the median, RollingMedian's mean runtime is 1.8 milliseconds, vs roll\_median's mean runtime of 637 milliseconds. While both are fast in the absolute, it is easy to imagine having to run the analysis on several thousand time series with, e.g. daily data. Suppose in a financial application, 2,000 stocks with decades of daily data had to be analyzed. RollingMedian would complete in less than 4 seconds, while roll\_median would take 21 minutes. Trying to calculate the same using pure [R] code would be _much_ slower still.
